## This folder contains two subfolders:

1. morse_DMT: this folder contains the implementation for real discrete morse theory and captures the real morse structure. 

It works for 2D and 3D vessel data.

2. persistence_ws: this folder contains the implementation for persistence-based watershed algorithm. It's a relaxed version of morse structure.

It works for 2D and 3D volume data.
