## This folder contains three subfolders:

1. morse_DMT: this folder contains the implementation for real discrete morse theory and captures the real morse structure. 

It works for 2D and 3D verssel data.

2. persistence_ws: this folder contains the implementation for persistence-based watershed algorithm. It's a relaxed version of morse structure.

It works for 2D and 3D volume data.

3. Related papers: this folder contains an (imcomplete) list of related works.

There are also README files in the subfolders guiding how to run the codes.
